# Neighborhood React map

### -A Udacity FEND (Front End Nano Degree) project


#### Project overview
In this project, I was given the task of creating a single-page application using *Google Maps API*, *React* and a *third-party API*.

I chose *Foursquare*.

The third-party API must be included in the Google Maps, to show additional info about the places that are pinpointed.


#### Criterias

1.  The site is responsive
2.  Location filter with list view and seamlessly connected to the location markers
3.  Asynchronous API requests with error handling
4.  A detailed README
5.  Additional location data from at third-party API
6.  Accessibility - add focus and semantics
7.  Offline use via service worker
8.  Proper use of React
9.  NO ERRORS!


#### How to
You can not view this site by simply double-clicking the index.html.

To view the site in a proper manner, download my [repo](https://github.com/Mangkoot/NeighborhoodFEND.git).

CD into the *master* branch.

Type *npm install*.

Then type *npm start*.

The project will now be available at **localhost:3000**.
